[**HyperAgency**](https://h9y.ai/) is an **Agentic AI Operating System** that replaces brittle, fragile automations with **long-lived, self-improving systems**. HyperAgency allows organizations to deploy autonomous agents that **remember, adapt, and act on your behalf**, under **human governance and auditability**.  

It is **open-source, model-agnostic, and cloud/self-hosted**, providing the infrastructure to build **fully autonomous AI-human organizations**.

> 🧠 Think of HyperAgency as your **operating system for autonomous workflows** — distributed, flexible, and composable.

📘 Explore the [**HyperAgency Documentation**](https://docs.h9y.ai) for full capabilities, architecture, agent archetypes, integration examples, and step-by-step guides.  

📄 Read the [**HyperAgency Research Paper**](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.27454.55365) for the system design, implementation and use cases.

## 🚀 What is HyperAgency?

HyperAgency is more than an AI platform — it's a **new operational layer**:

- **Persistent Agency** — agents maintain memory and context across time, adapting to real-world changes.  
- **Coordinated Intelligence** — multiple agents work together to solve complex problems.  
- **Human Governance** — clear approval points, credential management, and auditable behavior.  
- **Omni-Channel Connectivity** — integrate across messengers, web apps, email, and APIs.  
- **Decentralized Architecture** — connect multiple HyperAgency instances for distributed collaboration.  
- **Web3 Marketplace** — publish, buy, and monetize agentic workflows and HyperAgents.  
- **MetaAgent** — self-developing AI that creates, evolves, and orchestrates agents autonomously.

> HyperAgency turns AI from **fragile scripts and prompts** into **living, compound intelligence systems**.

## 📦 Installation

> You can **self-host HyperAgency locally** in just a few steps —
> or skip the setup entirely and **use our cloud environment** for a faster start.

### 🧰 Prerequisites

To run HyperAgency locally, install the following:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)

---

### ☁️ Prefer Not to Self-Host?

If you don’t want to manage infrastructure yourself, you can request access to our hosted **HyperAgency Cloud**, where everything is pre-configured and ready to use.

👉 [Get Cloud Access](https://h9y.ai/signup)

> The cloud environment is perfect for early testing, team collaboration, or demoing agentic flows without running Docker or Vault locally.

---

### Option A: Simple Install

```bash
mkdir hyperagency
cd hyperagency/

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vuics/h9y/refs/heads/main/install.sh | sh

# RECOMMENDED: Generate TLS certificates.
#   (Otherwise, use your own certificates.)
./gen-certs.sh

# OPTIONALLY: Setup DNS with /etc/hosts
./setup-hosts.sh
```

Run:
```bash
docker compose up
```

Open [h9y.localhost](https://h9y.localhost) in the browser. To unlock Vault for secure storage of keys, see the section "Initialize Vault" below.

---

### Option B: Install from Repo


#### 📦 1. Clone the Repository with Submodules

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vuics/h9y.git
cd h9y
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### ⚙️ 2. Configure .Env Files

Copy and customize `.env` files for the main platform and submodules:
```bash
cp env.example .env
```

#### 🔐 3. Generate TLS Certificates

```bash
./gen-certs.sh
```

On macOS, double-click each `.crt` file in `./certs/` to trust them in **Keychain Access**.

#### 🌐 4. Configure Local DNS (Optionally)

If your domain is `h9y.localhost` or anything on localhost, you may not need to configure the DNS, since the locahost often resolves to `127.0.0.1` automatically.

If your domain name does not resolve, set up `/etc/hosts` entries:
```bash
sudo ./setup-hosts.sh
```

#### 🧱 5. Start the Stack

Use Docker Compose to start all services:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

After you started the stack, you can open in the browser:

| App Name | URL                                                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| App      | [h9y.localhost](https://h9y.localhost)                   |
| API      | [api.h9y.localhost](https://api.h9y.localhost)           |
| Vault    | [vault.h9y.localhost](https://vault.h9y.localhost)       |
| Langflow | [langflow.h9y.localhost](https://langflow.h9y.localhost) |
| Nodered  | [nodered.h9y.localhost](https://nodered.h9y.localhost)   |

NOTE: Replace `h9y.localhost` with your `${DOMAIN}`.

### 🔑 Initialize Vault

1. Open [Vault](https://vault.h9y.localhost) (replace `h9y.localhost` with your `${DOMAIN}`), and input:
  • Key shares: `5`
  • Key threshold: `3`
2. Set the env vars with displayed initial root token and the keys in the `.env` file in the format:
  ```bash
  VAULT_TOKEN=(Initial root token)
  VAULT_UNSEAL_KEYS=(Key 1),(Key 2),(Key 3),(Key 4),(Key 5)
  ```
3. Unseal the vault by inputing 3 of the keys, and sing into vault with the initial root token.
4. Enable new engine with type KV (kv-v2) and path `secret`.
5. Restart Docker Compose.
  ```bash
  docker compose down
  docker compose up
  ```
---

### 🛑 Stop the Stack

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

### 👥 Compose Profiles

HyperAgency ships with **predefined Docker Compose profiles** that let you start small, scale fast, and run *exactly* what you need—no more, no less. Profiles align the platform with your **intent**, from first exploration to a full, production-grade agentic stack.

| Profile Name | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `try`        | **Minimal, zero‑friction setup** to explore HyperAgency (default). Ideal for first‑time users, quick demos, and experiments. |
| `h9y`        | **Core HyperAgency services** included in the `h9y` repository. Best for active development and local iteration.             |
| `all`        | **Complete HyperAgency Cloud stack**, mirroring the services available at [HyperAgency Cloud](https://h9y.ai).               |

You can find the **exhaustive list of available profiles** in the [`docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/vuics/h9y/blob/main/docker-compose.yml).

#### ⚙️ Selecting a Profile

Choose the profile that matches your current goal by setting it in the [`.env`](https://github.com/vuics/h9y/blob/main/env.example) file:
```bash
COMPOSE_PROFILES=h9y
```

You can enable multiple profiles and Docker Compose will merge them into a single runtime configuration:
```bash
COMPOSE_PROFILES=try,logs,metrics
```

Then start HyperAgency using Docker Compose as usual. Docker will run **only** the services associated with the selected profiles.
